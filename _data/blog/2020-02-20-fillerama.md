# This is my first post here.

At first, I wanted to create a blog using **React.js** with blog entries stored on **MongoDB** as HTML strings (I know, the idea was pretty lame). But, **Gatsby.js** popped out on my way, so I was like why not migrate to Gatsby? Since I was learning Gatsby on the go, I decided to try **Material UI** as well, because why not? I found a good tutorial on blog development with Gatsby and started coding. It took me two nights, 2.5 redbulls and dozens of visits to stackoverflow to finish the project.  Later, I bought a domain on name.com, configured DNS to **Netlify** and voil√†: my blog is up and running.

# Personal blog built using Gatsby.js

This blog was built on top of an existing template made by [W3Layouts](https://w3layouts.com), which can be viewed using:

```bash
npm install --save gatsby
gatsby new gatsby-starter-delog https://github.com/W3Layouts/gatsby-starter-delog
```

However, significant amount of work was put into design and functionality. More on how it was built and which additional frameworks were used can be read on my [blog post](https://janarosmonaliev.com/discovering-gatsby-js).

To make things easier, above is a structure of my blog that is portrayed in the highest level of abstraction possible, while retaining the overall logic.
